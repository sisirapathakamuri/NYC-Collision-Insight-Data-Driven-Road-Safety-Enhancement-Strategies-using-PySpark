The project report on Motor Vehicle Collisions and Crashes in New York is structured into several key sections, each elaborating on different aspects of the project from conceptualization to findings and recommendations:

Introduction
This section outlines the project's purpose, focusing on analyzing a comprehensive dataset of motor vehicle collisions in New York. The aim is to explore contributing factors, identify high-risk areas, and understand accident impacts to inform road safety strategies.

Objective
The project aims to analyze collision data to uncover insights into road safety, identifying patterns such as peak collision times, frequent causative factors, high-risk zones, and evaluating accident severity. These insights will guide recommendations for policymakers, urban planners, and traffic authorities to improve road safety.

Dataset Description
Data was sourced from Data.gov and includes detailed information on road accidents, including timestamps, locations, vehicle details, injury and fatality data, causal factors, and other relevant attributes. The dataset comprises 31 variables and 103,880 records, serving as the foundation for analysis.

Prediction, Inference, and Goals
The project sets out to predict accident severity and identify key predictors such as location, time, and contributing factors. Utilizing machine learning models like Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Linear Regression, the goals include identifying high-risk zones, causative factors, evaluating accident severity, and recommending safety improvements.

Data Exploration and Analysis
This segment details the exploratory data analysis (EDA) process, including data cleaning, handling missing values, and deriving insights from the data. Key insights include identifying vehicle types most involved in collisions, borough-based analysis highlighting areas with higher collision rates, and causal analysis to determine frequent reasons for accidents.

Modelling Strategy
The approach involves data preprocessing, feature selection, and applying various machine learning models to predict outcomes and classify accident severity. The models include Linear Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, and Logistic Regression for multi-class classification.

Results Summary
The outcomes of the analysis are presented, showing the performance of the models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The linear regression model demonstrated a significant ability to explain variability in the dependent variable, while the classification models varied in their predictive accuracy and precision.

Comparative Analysis and Problems Encountered
This section compares the performance of the classification models and discusses challenges such as handling categorical variables, large data sizes, weak correlations, and feature selection for the Random Forest classifier.

Conclusion
The project successfully achieved its prediction and inference goals, though it suggests that results could be further improved with more extensive feature selection and transformation. This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights for enhancing road safety and guiding policy and infrastructure decisions in New York City. give a unique name for this project
